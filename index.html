                <li>open – alternative to walled gardens</li>
                <li>expanding what the web is and can be</li>
                <li>a medium for creative expression for self-expression</li>
                <li>keeping it out of museums (alive!)</li>
                <li>part of us and the physical world</li>
                <li>creating alternatives to social media/big tech</li>
                <li>space for optimism outside of the silicon valley and investor speculation</li>
                <li>lightweight, intentional, poetic</li>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Connect internet movements, publications, associations, institutions, and collectives, working on keeping the web alive and at the same time, enrich the public perception of the internet.</li>
                <li>Inspire artists and curious souls to reconsider how to use the internet in their own practice by presenting them with novel approaches, thoughts, cases and methodologies. </li>
                <li>Support the professional development of internet artists who avoid nostalgia and technological utopias but use the internet and the open protocols to keep the web alive.</li>
                <li>Develop a new language for the internet which moves away from the cynical and binary (soft/hard, problem/solution, utopia/dystopia), allowing us to see the internet and the world anew.</li>
